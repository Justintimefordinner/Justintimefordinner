### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Justintimefordinner/Justintimefordinner** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a super-duper awesome portfolio website

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning not to hate on Javascript

âš¡ Fun fact: The pool on the Titanic is still filled
